  <h1>Effects of Internet on Mental Health</h1>
  <div class="textBox">
    <p>The modern way of life, computerization and the influence of Internet lead to the change of way of life from the earliest age. The risk factors of man's health are imposed upon from an early phase of adolescence. Adolescence is a period of
      adjustment, a time of physical and emotional changes and changes in behaviour. It is a stressful life period where even the normal maturing gait includes a certain amount of emotional
      disturbance, as to oneself, so unto others.
      <br>
      Adolescence is also a phase of developing an identity and building peer relationships so their online activities mainly focus on interacting with peers. For precisely this reason, THE INTERNET, as a
      leading form of mass media, greatly affects thier health.

    <h3> The Link between Social Media and Mental Health</h3>
    <p>Many experts have described a rise in sleeplessness, loneliness, worry, and dependence among teenagers — a rise that coincides with the release of the first iPhone 10 years ago. One study found that 48 percent of teens who spend five hours per
      day on an electronic device have at least one suicide risk factor, compared to 33 percent of teens who spend two hours a day on an electronic device. We’ve all heard anecdotes, too, of teens being reduced to tears from the constant
      communication and comparisons that social media invites. We are seeing many teens with with anxiety, poor self-esteem, insecurity, and sadness which is partly because of the usage of internet right from a tender age.</p>

  <div class="textBox4">
    <h5>Social media use can lead to low quality sleep and harm mental health. It has associations with depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.</h5>

    <h5>Filters are fun, but also fake</h5>

    <p>Constantly seeing other picture-perfect highlight reels can make it feel impossible to live up to other people’s lives.</p>

    <h6>Some Negative Effects on Health</h6>
    <p>Social media may trigger feelings of inadequacy. People may feel as though their life or appearance does not compare favorably with that of others on social media, leading to feelings of envy and dissatisfaction. Social media can also
      facilitate cyberbullying and create unhealthy self-centeredness and distance from friends and family.
      Here are some other negative effects:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Feeling increased anxiety and/or loneliness </li>
      <li>Spending more time on social media and not with friends and family</li>
      <li>Lack of physical exercise</li>
      <li>Frequently feeling jealous of others</li>
      <li>Being Trolled or Cyberbullied online can lead to depression</li>
      <li>School work and relationships get affected</li>
      <li>Almost addictive</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="textBox6">
    <h6>Important Statistics</h6>
    <p>Over 40% of ADOLESCENT GIRLS and over 20% of ADOLESCENT BOYS report using social media for 3 or more hours per day. The most popular social media platforms are Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. Almost 25% of ADOLESCENTS
      believe that social media has a mostly negative effect.
      With 13% of 12-17 year olds reporting DEPRESSION and 32% reporting anxiety, mental illness is a concern for adolescent health. Many sources tell that there is association between time spent on social media as well as the number of social media
      platforms used, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.
      As many as 72% of teens say that they have been CYBERBULLIED at some point.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="textbox7">
    <h6> Tips for Managing these effects</h6>
    <p> The world is hooked on to social media : the average person spends about 145 minutes on social media every day. Cumulatively, social media users the world over spend a total of 3.7 trillion hours on social media in 2021 – equivalent to more
      than 420 million years of combined human existence. 42% of the total population in the world (3.2 billion) are active social media users (as of 2018), mostly on the mobile phone. A staggering 210 million people suffer from internet and social
      media addictions worldwide. So what exactly is the nature of this addiction ? Makes you wonder how to reduce Social Media use, right? </p>
    <br>
    <p> Here are some ways to do that: Pick a time at night after which you will not check your phone. Turn off your notifications for at least a few hours each day. Choose one day a week where you take a day off from social media and focus on other
      things. Consider a digital detox program once a while. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="textbox8">
    <h6> What can Parents do about this? </h6>
    <p>Parents should check in regularly with their children to ensure that their online behavior is appropriate. Many parents do not know the popular social media sites and how they work. With many parents’ busy schedules, this leaves many kids
      unsupervised on the internet, which can lead to problems. One thing you can do is check in with your children and let them know that it is safe to come to you if they are experiencing cyberbullying.Parental supervision is as valuable online as
      it is offline when it comes to instilling values and safeguards. Taking your teen’s phone away if you suspect drama is not the right solution. Doing so won’t get to the heart of the social issue at play. Be good role models in your own use of
      tech. Remind teens that what they post can be used against them. Teach kids not to share anything on social media that they wouldn't want their teachers, college admissions officers, future bosses — and yes, grandma — to see. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="textbox9">
    <h6> Don't overlook the benefits </h6>
    <p> Despite its drawbacks, social media remains an efficient means of connecting communities and individuals across the world. Adolescence is a time when connections with peers is increasingly important, and social media provides opportunities
      for social connection. It can help young people form communities, keep in touch with friends who do not live nearby, and it can provide a place to get social support. Social media can provide a valuable connection to one’s peers. So using it in
      the limit and knowing when to use it efficiently is very essential. The abundant INFORMATION, inexhuastible education, social networking and learning are some benefits that all the kids and teens should be given access to.
